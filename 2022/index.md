### Abstract

Recent years have seen rapid progress in meta-learning methods, which transfer knowledge across tasks and domains to efficiently learn new tasks, optimize the learning process itself, and even generate new learning methods from scratch. Meta-learning can be seen as the logical conclusion of the arc that machine learning has undergone in the last decade, from learning classifiers, to learning representations, and finally to learning algorithms that themselves acquire representations, classifiers, and policies for acting in environments. In practice, meta-learning has been shown to yield new state-of-the-art automated machine learning methods, novel deep learning architectures, and substantially improved one-shot learning systems. Moreover, improving one’s own learning capabilities through experience can also be viewed as a hallmark of intelligent beings, and neuroscience shows a strong connection between human and reward learning and the growing sub-field of meta-reinforcement learning. 

Some of the fundamental questions that this workshop aims to address are:

- What are the meta-learning processes in nature (e.g., in humans), and how can we take inspiration from them?
- What is the relationship between meta-learning, continual learning, and transfer learning?
- What interactions exist between meta-learning and large pretrained / foundation models? 
- What principles can we learn from meta-learning to help us design the next generation of learning systems?
- What kind of theoretical principles can we develop for meta-learning? 
- How can we exploit our domain knowledge to effectively guide the meta-learning process and make it more efficient?
- How can be design better benchmarks for different meta-learning scenarios?

As prospective participants, we primarily target machine learning researchers interested in the questions and foci outlined above. Specific target communities within machine learning include, but are not limited to: meta-learning, AutoML, reinforcement learning, deep learning, optimization, evolutionary computation, and Bayesian optimization. We also invite submissions from researchers who study human learning and neuroscience, to provide a broad and interdisciplinary perspective to the attendees.

### Important Dates

- Submission deadline: October 3rd, 2022, 17:00 CEST
- Author Notification: October 20th, 2022, AoE
- SlidesLive recording deadline: November 10th, 2022, AoE
- Camera-ready paper submission deadline: November 20th, 2022, AoE
- Poster submission deadline: November 25th, 2022, AoE

### Formatting

We have provided a modified `.sty` file [here](neurips_2022.sty) that appropriately lists the name of the workshop when `\neuripsfinal` is enabled. Please use this style file in conjunction with the corresponding LaTeX `.tex` template from the [NeurIPS website](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) to submit a final camera-ready copy. Both the submission and the camera-ready can be up to **4 pages** (excluding acknowledgements, references and appendices).

[Start your submission](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/MetaLearn).

### Publication

Accepted papers and supplementary material will be made available on the workshop website. However, these do not constitute archival publications and no formal workshop proceedings will be made available, meaning contributors are free to publish their work in archival journals or conferences.

### FAQ

1. Can supplementary material be added beyond the 4-page limit for submissions, and are there any restrictions on it?

   Yes, you may include additional supplementary material, but you should ensure that the main paper is self-contained, since looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers. The supplementary material should also follow the same NeurIPS format as the paper.
   
1. Are references included in the 4-page limit?
   
   No, references will not count towards the page limit.

1. Can a submission to this workshop be submitted to another NeurIPS workshop in parallel?

   We discourage this, as it leads to more work for reviewers across multiple workshops. Our suggestion is to pick one workshop to submit to.

1. Can a paper be submitted to the workshop that has already appeared at a previous conference with published proceedings?

   We won't be accepting such submissions unless they have been adapted to contain significantly new results (where novelty is one of the qualities reviewers will be asked to evaluate).

1. Can a paper be submitted to the workshop that is currently under review or will be under review at a conference during the review phase?

   From our side, it is perfectly fine to submit a condensed version of a parallel conference submission if it is also fine for the conference in question. Our workshop does not have archival proceedings, and therefore parallel submissions of extended versions to other conferences are acceptable.
  
## Review Process

tl;dr: The review process will be **double-blind**. Please sign up to be, or recommend, a reviewer via [https://forms.gle/EW4icbYv5uA8A13KA](https://forms.gle/EW4icbYv5uA8A13KA).

### Important Dates

- Assignments of reviewers to papers (start of review phase): October 4th, 2022
- **Final reviewing deadline**: October 18th, 2022, AoE

### Reviewing Guidelines
We encourage all reviewers to check [our reviewing guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRdY8e2ttALw_kzxviejrhkVkiJlJ7YiS3yGm9jykB0/edit).
